notes to self:

otrtalk is an ongoing experiment. the idea is to keep iterating and improving/replacing on the protocols, UI/UX

some things to think about:

UI/UX: need to work on a GUI --> node-webkit/nw

otrtalk-id:
	is it really necessary, why not get rid of it and just use the OTR fingerprint as our identity.
	less info to exchange, and seting up profile/buddies easier..
	this will mean a breaking change in the discovery protocol

exchanging/publishing OTR key fingerprint:
	how can we easily and securely exchange the OTR key fingerprint with our buddies. (same issues as PGP)
	especially for if/when we change/loose our keys:
	look into:
		storing them in namecoin, dnschain
		https://keybase.io <<--- cool project
		...

metadata:
	- telehash-v1 is not encrypted protocol.. too much metadata flying around:
	we could encrypt and sign metadata (mainly our ip address:port)
	key can be derived from shared SMP secret on first connect, and portion of shared sym key
	(this should also help to ensure we don't connect to or accept connections from nodes we are not interested in)
	- Using a constant identifier hashname of (otrtalk-id or OTR fingerprint) in discovery protocol can reveal
	who we are talking to.. should be 'salted' with a shared string/key (derived from SMP secret and on subsequent sessions
	from shared sym key..) having shared secret from session to session we could also do SMP on every connection setup,
	not just first time.
	- moving to telehash-v3 might be a good idea..

anonymity:
	- using otrtalk on zerotier-one is ok. Adding a 'direct-connect' to ip:port option (skipping discovery/telehash)
		would be nice.
	- otrtalk works well over a vpn..
	- will eventually support using otrtalk over TOR (just need to finish the udp-proxy over http/websockets)
	- look into running some telehash nodes in i2p and other darknets
	- maybe add a feature to do a one-time chat with a new temporary profile that is removed after a chat ends.
